## 📌 Overview
The **DevSolve Club Website** is the official online platform for our project-based, problem-solving club.  
It serves as the central hub for:
- **Club information**
- **Guidelines and rules for joining**
- **Separate registration for Juniors and Seniors**
- **Showcasing our mission and values**

The website is designed to grow alongside the club, starting as a **simple, functional platform** and evolving into a **full-featured project hub** over time.

This website:
